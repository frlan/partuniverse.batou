# Django-Deployment with batou

This is an example deployment for partuniverse with batou. You might use it to build up your own batou-deployment or having a test environment.

## Dependencies

To run batou itself you only need

* Python 2.7.x > 2.7.9 and
* python-virtualenv
* gpg(2)

installed on your system. batou is creating a virtualenv and downloading everything else needed from pypi.

To run your own local (development) box provided by this repository you will also need:

* vagrant (tested with vagrant 1.8+)
* VirtualBox

## Vagrant box

The provided vagrant-box is based on [Flying Circus ](https://flyingcircus.io) NixOS box. To make usage of run:

```
$ vagrant up
$ ./batou deploy vagrant
```

vagrant will create a virtual machine using VirtualBox as defined
inside `Vagrantfile` and running configuration as defined in
`provision.nix`.
